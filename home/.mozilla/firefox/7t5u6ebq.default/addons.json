For a simpler tool and less advanced configuration options, please use FoxyProxy Basic.","fullDescription":"WHAT IS IT?\nFoxyProxy is a Firefox extension which automatically switches an internet connection across one or more proxy servers based on URL patterns. Put simply, FoxyProxy automates the manual process of editing Firefox's Connection Settings dialog. Proxy server switching occurs based on the loading URL and the switching rules you define.\n\n* Custom colors make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n* Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when\n* (optional) Automatically synchronize all of your proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync. Import/Export settings to files when not using Firefox Sync.\n* Import/Export patterns to share with others.\n\nUPGRADING\nPlease import your old FoxyProxy settings using the Import button.\n\nOlder Firefox Versions\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/versions/\nFor pre-Firefox 57 (Quantum), install FoxyProxy 4.6.5. from here:\nhttps://github.com/foxyproxy/firefox-extension/blob/master/archive/dist/foxyproxy-standard/4.6.5/foxyproxy_standard-4.6.5-fx%2Bsm%2Btb.xpi\nNote: 4.6.5 is not maintained.\n\nPERMISSIONS\nThe \"Download files\" permission is used to export FoxyProxy settings to a file (so you can import it elsewhere). The \"Download history\" permission is required only because Firefox does not allow add-ons to specify just \"download files\" without \"download history\". It's all or nothing. Internally, nothing is done with your download history. This is open source software and you can view the code yourself by unzipping the downloaded then using a text viewer, or by visiting https://github.com/foxyproxy/firefox-extension\n\n\"Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data\": this is used by the big eraser button since version 6.3. You can delete cookies, cache, etc with one-click. A future version will allow you to clear the data automatically when switching proxies, just like the old FoxyProxy (pre-Firefox Quantum / Firefox 57).\n\nANDROID\nSince Firefox on Android does not support the proxyAPI, FoxyProxy does not work. This is a limitation of Firefox on Android, not FoxyProxy. There are currently no Firefox for Android add-ons which manipulate proxy settings.\n\n    Switch proxies with URL pattern matching\n    Custom colors make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n    Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when\n    (optional) Automatically synchronize all of your proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync. Import/Export settings to files when not using Firefox Sync\n    Import/Export patterns to share with others.","weeklyDownloads":16132,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Eric H.
